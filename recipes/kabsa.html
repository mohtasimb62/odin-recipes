        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Kabsa is a rice dish that is enjoyed throughout the Gulf States of the Arabian Peninsula. Heavily influenced by Persian and Indian biryanis, 
            kabsa makes use of the water that was used for cooking fish or meat and re-using it to cook the spiced, long-grain rice in it, perfectly blending all 
            the flavors and spices.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>¼ cup tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
            <li>3 carrots, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>2 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>

            <li>3 ¼ cups hot water, plus more if needed</li>
            <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups unrinsed basmati rice</li>
            <li>¼ cup raisins</li>
            <li>¼ cup toasted slivered almonds</li>
        </ol>
        

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make spice mix: Stir together saffron, cinnamon, allspice, lime powder, cardamom, and white pepper in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Make dish: Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in butter 
                until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, 
                until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato purée.</li>
            <li>Stir in canned tomatoes with juice, carrots, cloves, nutmeg, cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and reserved spice mix. 
                Cook for about 3 minutes; pour in water and add chicken bouillon cube.</li>
            <li>Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat, and cover the pot. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently stir in rice. Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender and almost dry, about 25 minutes; add raisins and a little 
                more hot water, if necessary. Cover and cook until rice grains separate, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer rice to a large serving platter and arrange chicken on top. Sprinkle with toasted slivered almonds.</li>
        </ol>

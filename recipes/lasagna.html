        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese),
            Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on many different 
            recipes over the years.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>

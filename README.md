# Recipe Project

## Recipe Website
This is a basic recipe website project for me to practice and showcase my HTML skills. The website consists of a main index page with links to several recipes. While the website won't have an appealing design initially, it's important to remember that this project focuses on strengthening my HTML proficiency. The styling aspect of the website will be revisited in the future using CSS.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML. It serves as an opportunity for me to apply the HTML knowledge I have acquired and gain practical experience in creating web pages. The website's main page will provide links to different recipes, enabling users to navigate to specific recipe pages.

Please note that this project does not focus on aesthetics or visual design. It aims to enhance your understanding and implementation of HTML elements, tags, and structure. The visual aspect of the website will be addressed in the future through the application of CSS.

## Website Structure
The website structure is straightforward and consists of the following components:

- _index.html:_ The main page of the website, serving as the entry point for users. It contains links to various recipe pages.

- _lasagna.html, shawarma.html, kabsa.html:_ These are individual recipe pages, each with its own unique content and instructions.

Feel free to modify the structure as per your requirements or add more recipes to expand the website.

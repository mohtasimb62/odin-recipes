Recipe Website
This is a basic recipe website project designed to help you practice and showcase your HTML skills. The website consists of a main index page with links to several recipes. While the website won't have an appealing design initially, it's important to remember that this project focuses on strengthening your HTML proficiency. The styling aspect of the website will be revisited in the future using CSS.
